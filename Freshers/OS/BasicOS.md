## Basic OS questions

1. Process and threads, explain. Why use them, what are the differences?
2. Virtual memory, what it is, why is it required?
3. What is the difference between a Linux OS running on PC and Linux OS running on your phone (architecture, basic difference, like why one can't run on another)?
